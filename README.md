# CountriesDemo.WPF

In this WPF .NET Core app I practiced API requests and deserializing API responses, as well as CRU of CRUD using SQL Server database and Dapper.
I worked on this project in September 2020.
The project structure is highly inefficient and prevents unit testing. I am constantly working on improving my skills and in my next project I implemented MVVM design pattern as well as Dependency Injection.
