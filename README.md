# CountriesDemo.WPF
<p>
  In this WPF .NET Core app I practiced API requests and deserializing API responses,
  <br>
  as well as CRU of CRUD using SQL Server database and Dapper.
<p/>
<p>
  I worked on this project in September 2020.
  <br>
  The project structure is highly inefficient and prevents unit testing.
  <br>
  I am constantly working on improving my skills and in my next project ([DeliveriesDemo]()) I implemented MVVM design pattern as well as Dependency Injection.
